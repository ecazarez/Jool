This folder contains the source of the userspace application of Jool.

The userspace application is a client which can be used to send requests to
Jool, which resides in the kernel. It comes with a man page, but you might want
to read more documentation at
https://www.jool.mx/en/documentation.html.

If you're not using git, install using `./configure && make && make install` as
the INSTALL file says.

The configure script will typically trip while looking for the Netlink
or the pkg-config dependency. If you're using Ubuntu, run
`apt install libnl-3-dev pkg-config` to fix that. Alternatively or otherwise,
get Netlink from http://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/.

If you cloned the code using git, keep in mind that we do not upload the
autotools generated files to the repository, so you have two options:

1.  Ignore this directory, download the distribution instead and compile that:
    https://www.jool.mx/en/download.html

2.  Install the autotools, run ./autogen.sh, and then
    `./configure && make && make install` as stated above.
