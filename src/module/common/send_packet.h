 * network.
 *
 * We need this because the kernel assumes that when a packet enters a module,
 * a packet featuring the same layer-3 protocol exits the module. So we can't
 * just morph IPv4 packets into IPv6 ones and vice-versa; we need to ask the
 * kernel to drop the original packets and send new ones on our own.
