/**
 * Caller writes on the buffer. Once the buffer is full or the caller finishes
 * writing, the buffer is written into an skb and fetched.
 *
 * The caller does not work on the skb directly because:
 *
 * Rob had trouble making Generic Netlink work without attributes. It might be
 * impossible. We do not want to fetch attributes because we do not have any
 * warranty they will work the same in a different Linux kernel (which is
 * relevant in joold's case - the two NAT64s can be running in different
 * kernels). So what we did is use a single binary attribute. Userspace joold
 * unwraps the attribute and sends the binary data as is. The joold on the other
 * side should parse the data correctly because it is reasonable to expect
 * Jool's version to be the same.
 *
 * The problem with that is the binary blob needs to be ready by the time the
 * attribute is written into the packet. This is never the case for responses
 * to --display. In fact, it is also not true for joold.
 *
 * So we use a buffer to build the attribute content first and write the
 * attribute later.
 *
 * TODO (later) maybe find a way to do this without attributes?
